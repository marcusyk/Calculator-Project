This is a calculator project I made during the summer. It includes HTML/CSS and JavaScript. This was my first real project with these programming languages. 

In HTML, I coded all the artithmatic contents of the calculator. In CSS, I designed the colors, buttion transitions, and style of the calculator. In JavaScript, I programmed the functionality of the calculator. It is able to quicky and correctly provide solutions to arithmatic problems given.
